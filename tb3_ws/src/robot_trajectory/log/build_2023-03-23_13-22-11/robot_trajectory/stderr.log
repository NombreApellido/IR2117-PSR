CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindEigen_Dense.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Eigen_Dense", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen_Dense" with
  any of the following names:

    Eigen_DenseConfig.cmake
    eigen_dense-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Eigen_Dense" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Eigen_Dense_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Eigen_Dense" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
