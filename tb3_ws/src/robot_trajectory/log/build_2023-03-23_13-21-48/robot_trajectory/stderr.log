CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindEigen/Dense.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Eigen/Dense", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen/Dense" with
  any of the following names:

    Eigen/DenseConfig.cmake
    eigen/dense-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Eigen/Dense" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Eigen/Dense_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Eigen/Dense" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
