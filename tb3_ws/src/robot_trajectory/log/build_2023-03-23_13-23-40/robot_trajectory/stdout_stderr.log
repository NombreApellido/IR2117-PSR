CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindEigen3::Eigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Eigen3::Eigen", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3::Eigen"
  with any of the following names:

    Eigen3::EigenConfig.cmake
    eigen3::eigen-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3::Eigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Eigen3::Eigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Eigen3::Eigen" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
